Day camp is a great way for your Cub Scouts to get outside this summer in a safe way that allows them to experience the outdoors, but still come home after a fun day with friends. With activities that interest all Cubs, they are sue to have a great time, learn a new skill, and tell you about all of the fun they had on the car ride home!
