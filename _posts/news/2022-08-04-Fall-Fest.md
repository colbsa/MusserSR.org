The Musser outdoor fun continues in October as we host our Cub Scout Fall Fest - a full day of programs designed to keep the adventure of Cub Scouting alive for the whole family! Join us on Saturday October 15, 22, and 29 for all of the excitement. We’ll open a Sunday or two if the Saturdays fill quickly. Program will run 9AM - 4PM. Go to [MusserSR.org/fallfest](/weekend/fall-fest) for more details and to register!
