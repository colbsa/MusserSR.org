Making sure that Webelos and Arrow of Light Scouts are prepared to join Scouts BSA troops is an important task of any pack and den. Webelos Woods is designed to help make sure each Cub is prepared to join a troop in the coming months. Confidence they have all the skills necessary when they cross the bridge is a key to any successful crossover.

Webelos will experience a weekend of adventure, pitching their own tent and practicing Scout skills, as they make new friends while learning what Scouts BSA is all about. This piece of the Musser camping experience will have every body ready to take the next step in their Scouting adventure.

We are very excited to offer this program in the Spring of 2021.  We are working very hard to come up with an experience that the Scouts will not forget.  Look for more information later this Winter, in the meantime see what we are working on...

Plan-A will be an entire weekend experience with camping, Plan-B will be an awesome one FULL day experience.  As we get a little closer to the new date we will let you know the details of Adventures offered and the fun that will be had by all.
