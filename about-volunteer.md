Looking to spend more time in camp? Want to give back to Scouting and camp? Musser Scout Reservation is always looking for volunteers to help make camp an even greater place!

<h2>Campmasters <div class="h5">The Key to Outstanding Customer Service</div></h2>
A positive camping experience begins with welcoming and enthusiastic hosts. The campmasters fill this role of hosts during a weekend of camping. This group of registered Scouters perform unit check-in and check-out, as well as opening the Trading Post and helping with any problems that may arise. Campmasters are also encouraged to offer program for the Scouts in camp or assist with a camp improvement project.

Campmastering is a great way for a group of adult leaders to enjoy all the fun that camp has to offer in a whole new way. Contact campmaster@mussersr.org to learn more and to volunteer.

<h2>Cub Scout Day Camp</h2>
Are you looking for a fun way to spend a week of your time this summer? Join us for a week of Day Camp and help our Cub Scouts have a Wild West adventure this summer! Whether you love to teach Nature, STEM, Handicraft, Shooting Sports, or a different area, or you just want to help lead the Scouts from station to station, we need lots of folks to help provide the fun for the Cubs. Contact John.Bickel@scouting.org if you are interested in helping!

<h2>Camp Promotions Team <div class="h5">Share the Cub Scouting Adventure</div></h2>
Has your unit always come to Musser? Are you interested in sharing the Musser camping experience with others? Join the camp promotions team to help teach others about what Musser has to offer. Whether it’s promoting camp at district roundtables, or sharing weekend stories at a Pack meeting, we’re always looking for help promoting the Cub Scouting adventure.  
 
To join the camp promotions team, contact hello@mussersr.org for more information.

<h2>Adopt-A-Cabin / Adopt-A-Campsite <div class="h5">Earn Your Unit's Next Stay</div></h2>
Does your unit have a few leaders or parents who love camp and want to help us improve it? We are excited to reintroduce our Adopt-A-Cabin/Adopt-A-Campsite program in an effort to upgrade the many structures and campsites throughout Musser Scout Reservation. Your unit will “adopt” a cabin or campsite to help make it welcoming and functional through general repairs and beautification upgrades.

If you are interested in “adopting” a cabin or campsite, download [this information packet](/files/Adopt_A_Cabin_Campsite.pdf) and contact brian.lynn@scouting.org!

<h2>Camp Service &amp; Conservation Projects <div class="h5">Give-Back to Help Musser Shine</div></h2>
Do Scouts in your unit need to complete service hours for rank advancement, school, or religious institution? What better way to accomplish those hours than giving back to one of our camps! Units can either come to camp for the day or spend a few hours during a weekend camping trip helping make Musser Scout Reservation a better place. To arrange a service project, contact brian.lynn@scouting.org.
