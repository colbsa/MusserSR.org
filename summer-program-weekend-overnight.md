    <p>
      Weekend Overnight Camp at Musser is an extended weekend, Thursday evening through Sunday afternoon, program. With three nights and three days to enjoy the Musser camping experience, this next level of program introduces Cubs to a wide-array of camp activities. Meals are served family style as camp in canvas wall tents on platforms as a family or as a pack. A hallmark of this experience in the Choose Your Own Adventure program. We recommend Weekend Overnight Camp for all Cub Scouts - Tigers through Arrow of Light Scouts (1st - 5th graders).
