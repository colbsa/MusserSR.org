Musser Scout Reservation has partnered with Aramark, a nationally-recognized food service management company, to provide Scouts and Scouters with a well-balanced and nutritious meal plan - approved by a licensed dietician - for the duration of their stay in camp. Each meal includes a hot entree with at least one side; lunch and dinner also include a vegetable. There is a fruit and yogurt bar available at breakfast, and a salad bar at both lunch and dinner. Peanut butter and jelly are also available at both lunch and dinner. Hot and cold drinks are available at twin juice bars located along the center of the back wall of the dining hall.

Campers and adult leaders with dietary restrictions can note their individual restrictions with the camp's food service manager before they come to camp. We are more than happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions to ensure that campers and leaders have the best dining experience possible. If you have any questions on dietary restrictions, please [let us know](/contact?subject=Food).
